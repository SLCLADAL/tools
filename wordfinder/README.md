# WordFinder - LADAL Keyword-in-Context Concordancing Tool

## About

**WordFinder** is a browser-based concordancing tool developed by the [Language Technology and Data Analysis Laboratory (LADAL)](https://ladal.edu.au) at the University of Queensland. It allows researchers to search for words and phrases across a collection of plain-text files and explore the results as keyword-in-context (KWIC) concordance lines — with no R knowledge or software installation required.

The tool is built with [Shiny](https://shiny.posit.co/) and runs entirely in the browser via [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). All processing happens on the server; no data is stored.

::: {.callout-note}
This tool accompanies the LADAL tutorial [**Finding Words in Text: Concordancing with R**](https://ladal.edu.au/tutorials/kwics/kwics.html), which explains the methodology in depth and provides reusable R code for more advanced workflows.

## How to use

1. **Launch** the tool using one of the Binder links below.
2. **Upload** one or more `.txt` files using the *Upload texts* panel on the left. Each file becomes one document in the concordance.
3. **Enter a search term** — a single word, a phrase, or a regular expression.
4. **Configure** the context window, match type, and case sensitivity as needed.
5. **Click Search** to run the concordance.
6. **Explore** results in the interactive table (sort, filter, paginate).
7. **Download** the full results as Excel or CSV.

## Features

- Upload multiple `.txt` files (one file = one document in the concordance)
- Three match types via `quanteda::kwic()`:
  - **Fixed** — exact string matching
  - **Glob** — wildcard patterns (e.g. `wom*n`)
  - **Regex** — full regular expressions (e.g. `wom[ae]n`)
- Adjustable context window (1–15 words each side of the keyword)
- Case-sensitive or case-insensitive search
- Interactive concordance table with per-column filters, sorting, and pagination
- Keyword highlighted in purple for easy scanning
- Per-document frequency summary with normalised hits per 1,000 tokens
- Multi-pattern search (run several patterns at once and compare hit counts)
- Download results as **Excel** (`.xlsx`) or **CSV**

## Launch

::: {.callout-tip}
## Which link should I use?

Use **ARDC BinderHub** if you have an Australian or New Zealand research institution login (AAF or Tuakiri). It offers more computing resources and faster load times.

Use **MyBinder.org** if you do not have AAF/Tuakiri access. It is free and open to everyone but may occasionally be slower.

**ARDC BinderHub** *(recommended — requires AAF / Tuakiri login)*

## Input format

WordFinder accepts **plain-text files only** (`.txt`). Files should be:

- Saved with UTF-8 encoding where possible
- Unformatted (no Word `.docx`, no PDF, no HTML)
- One file per document — the filename becomes the document label in the results

There is no enforced size limit, but very large files (> 5 MB each) may slow the search. For very large corpora, consider splitting files or running the analysis locally in R using the [concordancing tutorial](https://ladal.edu.au/tutorials/kwics/kwics.html).
